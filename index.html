      <br><p>Though it may appear that punk culture has subsided in the New York metropolitan area, local punk heartthrobs, the ShitBIrds are keeping that spirit alive and well.
      We caught up with the band members to talk about their anticts at their latest show. So walk me through the night, how did we get to the end of the night where the entire venue was being engulfed in flames?
    "Well Keith Deofrio has this pyrotechnics man that is a major alcoholic. He likes to come as a guest of the band lots of the time, so this time he shows up hammered off his ass and has the brilliant idea of throwing a molotov cocktail into the bloody fireworks display. Before any of us knew it, the backing visuals to our show were engulfed in flames. We couldn't tell until the fire was right next to us, sure at this point it burned all the amplifiers but we thought the screeching was just our stage crew in the back not doing their job."
